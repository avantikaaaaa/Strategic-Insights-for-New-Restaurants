# Recommendations/Data Insights for the upcoming restaurants:-

1) For the up coming resturants i would suggest that they should go for quick bites, snacks sort of theme, 
as it looks like people are more interested in quick munching rather that lunch or dinner.
2) Good Location is also very important for offline customers to have a positive and fresh atmosphere.
3) For cusine i would pick either north indian or chinese and one can also make a nice fusion of
chinese and north indian dishes. And can be the point of attraction for the customers.
4) Good food quality at quite cheap rate is very effective strategy so if possible try to 
keep the range of cost as low as possible.
5) Providing pre-ordering and pre-booking facility for online as well as offline 
customers for quick delivery of food when customers arrive at restaurant.
6) And i would suggest to take a random check on customers to know if they do really enjoy the food,
because in the end that is what we want customers satisfaction.
