# Recommendations/Data Insights for the upcoming restaurants:-

1) For the up coming resturants i would suggest that they should go for quick bites, snacks sort of theme, 
as it looks like people are more interested in quick munching rather that lunch or dinner.
2) Good Location is also very important for offline customers to have a positive and fresh atmosphere.
3) For cusine i would pick either north indian or chinese and one can also make a nice fusion of
chinese and north indian dishes. And can be the point of attraction for the customers.
4) Good food quality at quite cheap rate is very effective strategy so if possible try to 
keep the range of cost as low as possible.
5) Providing pre-ordering and pre-booking facility for online as well as offline 
customers for quick delivery of food when customers arrive at restaurant.
6) And i would suggest to take a random check on customers to know if they do really enjoy the food,
because in the end that is what we want customers satisfaction.

#Observation: 59.3% of the restaurants accept online order and 40.7% don't. 
#Only 12.8% of the restaurants provide table booking facility whereas 87.2% don't.
'''Observation: We observe that maximum restaurants provide online ordering but not 
table booking facility. The number of restaurants providing table booking facility
but not online order is the least. More than 15000 restaurants don't provide online ordering 
as well as table booking facility.
So in case we are planning to start a restaurant and we want some facility to have a lower priority 
then we can think about this one'''
